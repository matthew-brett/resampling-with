Here's the bad-news-good-news message again: The bad news is that the subject
of inferential statistics is extremely difficult — not because it is complex
but rather because it is subtle. The cause of the difficulty is that the world
around us is difficult to understand, and spoon-fed mathematical
simplifications which you manipulate mechanically simply mislead you into
thinking you understand that about which you have not got a clue.

The good news is that you — and that means *you* , even if you say you are "no
good at mathematics" — can understand these problems with a layperson's hard
thinking, even if you have no mathematical background beyond arithmetic and you
think that you have no mathematical capability. That's because the difficulty
lies in such matters as pin-pointing the right question, and understanding how
to interpret your results.

The problems in the previous chapter were tough enough. But this chapter
considers problems with additional complications, such as when there are
more than two groups, or paired comparisons for the same units of
observation.

## Comparisons among more than two samples of counted data

### Example: Do Any of Four Treatments Affect Sex Ratio in Fruit Flies? {#sec-fruitfly-four}


This is an example of the general problem — **when the benchmark universe
proportion is known, is the proportion of the binomial population affected by
any of the treatments?**

Suppose that, instead of experimenting with just one type of radiation
treatment on the flies (as in @sec-fruitfly), you try *four* different
treatments, which we shall label A, B, C, and D. Treatment A produces fourteen
males and six females, but treatments B, C, and D produce ten, eleven, and ten
males, respectively. It is immediately obvious that there is no reason to think
that treatment B, C, or D affects the sex ratio. But what about treatment A?

A frequent and dangerous mistake made by young scientists is to scrounge around
in the data for the most extreme result, and then treat it as if it were the
only result. In the context of this example, it would be fallacious to think
that the probability of the fourteen-males-to-six females split observed for
treatment A is the same as the probability that we figured for a *single*
experiment in the example @sec-fruitfly. Instead, we must consider that our
benchmark universe is composed of *four sets* of twenty trials, each trial
having a 50-50 probability of being male. We can consider that our previous
trials 1-4 in @sec-fruitfly constitute a *single* new trial, and each
subsequent set of four previous trials constitute another new trial. We then
ask how likely a new trial of our sets of twenty flips is to produce *one* set
with fourteen or more of one or the other sex.

Let us make the procedure explicit, starting at the procedure from
@sec-fruitfly.  Again, we will check for 14 or more males, *or* 6 or fewer
males (meaning, 14 or more females).

* **Step 1.** Let tails = male, heads = female.
* **Step 2.** Flip twenty coins and count the number of tails (males).  Call
this the count for group A.  Repeat three more times to get counts for groups
B, C and D.
* **Step 5.** If *any* of the group counts for A, or B or C or D is 14 ore
more then record "Yes", or if *any* of the group counts A, B, C, D are 6 or
less (meaning >= 14 females), record "yes".   If neither is true, record "No".
* **Step 4.** Repeat steps 2 and 3 perhaps 100 times.
* **Step 5.** Calculate the proportion of "yes"  results in the 100 trials.
This proportion estimates the probability that a fruit fly population with
a proportion of 50 percent males will produce as many as 14 males, or as many
as 14 females, in at least one of four groups of 20 flies.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Calculate some values for the text below.
flies4 <- read.csv('data/fruitfly_trials4.csv', check.names=FALSE)
n_trials <- nrow(flies4)
yeses <- flies4[['Any >=14 or any <=6']]
n_any_gte_14 <- sum(yeses == 'Yes')
# And from the original table.
flies <- read.csv('data/fruitfly_trials.csv', check.names=FALSE)
n_flies <- 25
fly_counts <- head(flies[['# of tails']], n_flies)
n_both <- sum(fly_counts >= 14 | fly_counts <= 6)
```

We begin the trials with data as in @tbl-fruitfly-4-groups.
In `r int2tw(n_any_gte_14)` of the `r int2tw(n_trials)` simulation trials, one
or more one samples (groups) shows 14 or more males. Without even concerning
ourselves about whether we should be looking at males or females, or just
males, or needing to do more trials, we can see that it would be *very common
indeed* to have one of four treatments show fourteen or more of one sex just
by chance. This discovery clearly indicates that a result that would be fairly
unusual (`r int2tw(n_both)` in `r int2tw(n_flies)`) for a single sample alone
is commonplace in one of four observed samples.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Show the table.
ketable(head(flies4, n_trials),
        caption = "Results from 6 random trials for Fruitfly 4-group problem {#tbl-fruitfly-4-groups}")
```

::: {.notebook name="fruit_fly4" title="Fruit fly simulation of four groups"}

::: nb-only
This notebook uses simulation to test whether a result of 14 or more males, or 14 or more females, can frequently arise by chance, if we look at four groups at a time, in one trial.
:::

A key point of the notebook here is that each trial consists
of *four groups* of 20 randomly generated hypothetical fruit flies. And if we
consider 10,000 trials, we will be examining 40,000 sets of 20 fruit flies.

In each trial we generate 4 random samples (groups) of 20 fruit flies, and
for each, we count the number of males ("males"s) and then check whether
that group has more than 13 of either sex (actually, more than 13 "males"s
or less than 7 "males"). If it does, then we change a variable called
`unusual` to 1, which informs us that for this sample, at least 1 group
of 20 fruit flies had results as unusual as the results from the fruit flies
exposed to the four treatments.

After the 10,000 runs are made, we count the number of trials where one sample
had a group of fruit flies with 14 or more of either sex, and show the
results.

```{python}
import numpy as np
rnd = np.random.default_rng()

n_iters = 10_000

results = np.zeros(n_iters)

for i in range(n_iters):
    # unusual indicates whether we have obtained any trial group with more
    # than 13 of either sex. We start at 0 (= no).
    unusual = 0
    # Repeat the following steps 4 times to constitute 4 trial groups
    # (representing treatments A, B, C, and D) of 20 flies each.
    for j in range(4):
        flies = rnd.choice(['male', 'female'], size=20)
        n_males = np.sum(flies == 'male')
        if n_males >= 14 or n_males <= 6:
            unusual = 1
    # unusual now tells us whether we got a result as extreme as that
    # observed (unusual == 1 if we did, unusual == 0 if not). We must
    # keep track of this result in the results variable, for each experiment.
    results[i] = unusual

# The number of trials for which at least one of the four tests
# exceeded 13 males or 13 females.
k = np.sum(results)
kk = k / n_iters

print('Proportion of trials with one or more group >=14 or <=6 :', kk)
```

```{r}
n_iters <- 10000

results <- numeric(n_iters)

for (i in 1:n_iters) {
    # unusual indicates whether we have obtained any trial group with more
    # than 13 of either sex. We start at 0 (= no).
    unusual <- 0
    # Repeat the following steps 4 times to constitute 4 trial groups
    # (representing treatments A, B, C, and D) of 20 flies each.
    for (j in 1:4) {
        flies <- sample(c('male', 'female'), replace=TRUE, size=20)
        n_males <- sum(flies == 'male')
        if (n_males >= 13 | n_males <= 6) {
            unusual <- 1
        }
    }
    # unusual now tells us whether we got a result as extreme as that
    # observed (unusual == 1 if we did, unusual == 0 if not). We must
    # keep track of this result in the results variable, for each experiment.
    results[i] <- unusual
}

# The number of trials for which at least one of the four tests
# exceeded 13 males or 13 females.
k <- sum(results)
kk <- k / n_iters

message('Proportion of trials with one or more group >=14 or <=6 :', kk)
```

In one set of 10,000 trials, there were more than 13 males or more than 13
females `r round(get_var('kk') * 100)` percent of the time — clearly not an
unusual occurrence.

### Example: Do Four Psychological Treatments Differ in Effectiveness?

**Do Several Two-Outcome Samples Differ Among Themselves in Their
Proportions?**

Consider four different psychological treatments designed to
rehabilitate young offenders. Instead of a numerical test score,
there is only a "yes" or a "no" answer as to whether the young person has
kept their record clean or has gotten into trouble again. Call a clean record
"success".  Label the treatments P, R, S, and T, each of which is administered
to a separate group of twenty young offenders. The number of "success"
outcomes per group has been: P, 17; R, 10; S, 10; T, 7. Is it improbable that
all four groups come from the same universe?

This problem is like the placebo vs. cancer-cure problem, but now there
are more than two samples. It is also like the four-sample
irradiated-fruit flies example (@sec-fruitfly-four), except that now we are
*not* asking whether any or some of the samples differ from a *given
universe* (50-50 sex ratio in that case). Rather, we are now asking
whether there are differences *among* the samples themselves. Please
keep in mind that we are still dealing with two-outcome (success-or-failure,
yes-or-no, well-or-sick) problems. The outcomes fall into categories, to which
we give labels ("success" or "failure", "well" or "sick").  Later we shall
take up problems that are similar except that the outcomes are "quantitative"
— in that the outcomes are numbers rather than labels.

If all four groups were drawn from the same universe, that universe has
an estimated success rate of 17/20 + 10/20 + 10/20 + 7/20 = 44/80
= 55/100 = 55%, because the observed data *taken as a whole* constitute our
best guess as to the nature of the universe from which they come — again, *if*
they all come from the same universe. (Please think this matter over a bit,
because it is important and subtle. It may help you to notice the absence of
any *other* information about the universe from which they have all come, if
they have come from the same universe.)

Therefore, select twenty two-digit numbers for each group from the
random-number table, marking "success" for each number in the range 1 through
55 and "failure" for each number 56 through 100. Conduct a number of such
trials. Then count the proportion of times that the difference between the
highest and lowest groups is larger than the widest observed difference, the
difference between P and T (17-7 = 10). In @tbl-offenders, none of the first
six trials shows anywhere near as large a difference as the observed range of
10, suggesting that it would be rare for four treatments that are "really"
similar to show so great a difference. There is thus reason to believe that
P and T differ in their effects.

| Trial     |  P    | R     | S     | T     | Largest Minus Smallest |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------------------------|
| 1         | 11    | 9     | 8     | 12    | 4                      |
| 2         | 10    | 10    | 12    | 12    | 2                      |
| 3         | 9     | 12    | 8     | 12    | 4                      |
| 4         | 9     | 11    | 12    | 10    | 3                      |
| 5         | 10    | 10    | 11    | 12    | 1                      |
| 6         | 11    | 11    | 9     | 11    | 2                      |

: Results of Six Random Trials for Problem "offenders" {#tbl-offenders}

The strategy of the {{< var lang >}} solution to "offenders" is similar to the
strategy for previous problems in this chapter. The benchmark (null)
hypothesis is that the treatments do not differ in their effects observed, and
we estimate the probability that the observed results would occur by chance
using the benchmark universe. The only new twist is that we must instruct the
computer to find the groups with the highest and the lowest numbers of
success rates.

Using {{< var lang >}}, we generate four "treatments," each represented
by 20 labels.  We draw these 20 labels from the choices "success" or "failure", with a 55% chance of getting "success" and a 45% chance of "failure".  Follow along in the program for the rest of the procedure:

-->

Only `r int2tw(round(get_var('kk') * 100))` percent of the experiments with
randomly generated treatments from a common success rate of .55 produced
differences in excess of the observed maximum difference (10).

An alternative approach to this problem would be to deal with *each* result's
departure from the mean, rather than the largest difference among the pairs.
Once again, we want to deal with *absolute* departures, since we are interested
only in magnitude of difference. We could take the absolute value of the
differences, as above, but we will try something different here. *Squaring* the
differences also renders them all positive: this is a common approach in
statistics.

::: {.notebook name="offenders_squared" title="Simulation of offender strategies using squared differences"}

::: nb-only
This notebook uses squared differences in a simulation to test the null
hypothesis that the four treatments in question were each equally effective.
:::

The first step is to examine our data and calculate this measure: The
mean is 11, the differences (call *deviations from the mean*) are 6, 1, 1, and
4, the squared deviations are 36, 1, 1, and 16, and their sum is 54.  In {{<
var lang >}}:

```{python}
# The actual scores for each treatment.
treat_scores = np.array([17, 10, 10, 7])
# The mean.
m = np.mean(treat_scores)
# The four deviations from the mean
deviations = treat_scores - m
# Squared deviations.
sq_deviations = deviations ** 2
# Sum of squared deviations.
actual_sum_sq_deviations = np.sum(sq_deviations)
# Show the result.
actual_sum_sq_deviations
```

```{r}
# The actual scores for each treatment.
treat_scores <- c(17, 10, 10, 7)
# The mean.
m <- mean(treat_scores)
# The four deviations from the mean
deviations <- treat_scores - m
# Squared deviations.
sq_deviations <- deviations ** 2
# Sum of squared deviations.
actual_sum_sq_deviations <- sum(sq_deviations)
# Show the result.
actual_sum_sq_deviations
```

Our experiment will be, as before, to constitute four groups of 20 at random
from a universe with a 55 percent rehabilitation rate. We then calculate this
same measure for the random groups. If it is frequently larger than 54, then we
conclude that a uniform cure rate of 55 percent could easily have produced the
observed results. The program that follows also generates the four treatments
by using a `for` loop, rather than spelling out the {{< var sample >}} command
4 times as above. In {{< var lang >}}:

From this histogram, we see that in only about 1 percent of the cases did our
trial sum of squared differences equal or exceed 54, confirming our conclusion
that this is an unusual result. We can have {{< var lang >}} calculate this
proportion:

```{python}
# How many of the trials yielded a maximum difference greater than the
# observed maximum difference?
k = np.sum(scores >= actual_sum_sq_deviations)
# Convert to a proportion
kk = k / n_trials

print(f'Proportion >= {actual_sum_sq_deviations} was:', kk)
```

```{r}
# How many of the trials yielded a maximum difference greater than the
# observed maximum difference?
k <- sum(scores >= actual_sum_sq_deviations)
# Convert to a proportion
kk <- k / n_trials

message(paste('Proportion >=', actual_sum_sq_deviations, 'was:', kk))
```

The conventional way to approach this problem would be with what is known as
a [chi-squared test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test).

### Example: Three-way Comparison

In a national election poll of 750 respondents in May, 1992, George Bush
got 36 percent of the preferences (270 voters), Ross Perot got 30
percent (225 voters), and Bill Clinton got 28 percent (210 voters) (*Wall
Street Journal*, October 29, 1992, A16). Assuming that the poll was
representative of actual voting, how likely is it that Bush was actually
*behind* and just came out ahead in this poll by chance? Or to put it
differently, what was the probability that Bush actually had a plurality of
support, rather than that his apparent advantage was a matter of sampling
variability?  We test this by constructing a universe in which Bush is slightly
behind (in practice, just equal), and then drawing samples to see how likely it
is that those samples will show Bush ahead.

We must first find that universe — among all possible universes that yield
a conclusion contrary to the conclusion shown by the data, and one in which we
are interested — that has the highest probability of producing the observed
sample. With a two-person race the universe is obvious: a universe that is
evenly split except for a single vote against "our" candidate who is now in the
lead, i.e. in practice a 50-50 universe. In that simple case we then ask the
probability that *that* universe would produce a sample as far out in the
direction of the conclusion drawn from the observed sample as the observed
sample.

With a three-person race, however, the decision is not obvious (and if this
problem becomes too murky for you, skip over it; it is included here more for
fun than anything else). And there is no standard method for handling this
problem in conventional statistics (a solution in terms of a confidence
interval was first offered in 1992, and that one is very complicated and not
very satisfactory to me (JLS)). But the sort of thinking that we must labor to
accomplish is also required for any conventional solution; the difficulty is
inherent in the problem, rather than being inherent in resampling, and
resampling will be at least as simple and understandable as any formulaic
approach.

The relevant universe is (or so I think) a universe that is 35 Bush — 35 Perot
— 30 Clinton (for a race where the poll indicates a 36-30-28 split); the
35-35-30 universe is of interest because it is the universe that is closest to
the observed sample that does not provide a win for Bush (leaving out the
"undecideds" for convenience); it is roughly analogous to the 50-50 split in
the two-person race, though a clear-cut argument would require a lot more
discussion. A universe that is split 34-34-32, or any of the other possible
universes, is less likely to produce a 36-30-28 sample (such as was observed)
than is a 35-35-30 universe, I believe, but that is a checkable matter. (In
technical terms, it might be a "maximum likelihood universe" that we are
looking for.)

We might also try a 36-36-28 universe to see if that produces a result very
different than the 35-35-30 universe.

Among those universes where Bush is behind (or equal), a universe that is split
50-50-0 (with just one extra vote for the closest opponent to Bush) would be
the most likely to produce a 6 percent difference between the top two
candidates by chance, but we are not prepared to believe that the voters are
split in such a fashion. This assumption shows that we are bringing some
judgments to bear from outside the observed data.

For now, the point is not *how* to discover the appropriate benchmark
hypothesis, but rather its *criterion* — which is, I repeat, that universe
(among all possible universes) that yields a conclusion contrary to the
conclusion shown by the data (and in which we are interested) and that (among
such universes that yield such a conclusion) has the highest probability of
producing the observed sample.

Let's go through the logic again: 1) Bush apparently has a 6 percent lead over
the second-place candidate. 2) We ask if the second-place candidate might be
ahead if all voters were polled. We test that by setting up a universe in which
the second-place candidate is infinitesimally ahead (in practice, we make the
two top candidates equal in our hypothetical universe). And we make the
third-place candidate somewhere close to the top two candidates. 3) We then
draw samples from this universe and observe how often the result is a 6 percent
lead for the top candidate (who starts off just below equal in the universe).

From here on, the procedure is straightforward: Determine how likely that
universe is to produce a sample as far (or further) away in the direction of
"our" candidate winning. (One could do something like this even if the
candidate of interest were not now in the lead.)

This problem teaches again that one must think explicitly about the choice of
a benchmark hypothesis. The grounds for the choice of the benchmark hypothesis
should precede the program, or should be included as an extended comment within
the program.

This {{< var lang >}} code embodies the previous line of thought.

When we run this program with a 36-36-28 split, we also get a similar
result — 2.6 percent. That is, the analysis shows a probability of only
2.6 percent that Bush would score a 6 percentage point "victory" in the
sample, by chance, if the universe were split as specified. So Bush
could feels reasonably confident that at the time the poll was taken, he
was ahead of the other two candidates.

## Paired Comparisons With Counted Data

### Example: The Pig Rations Again, But Comparing Pairs of Pigs

This is a **Paired-Comparison Test**.

To illustrate how several different procedures can reasonably be used to
deal with a given problem, here is another way to decide whether pig
ration A is "really" better: We can assume that the order of the pig
scores listed *within each ration group* is random — perhaps the order
of the stalls the pigs were kept in, or their alphabetical-name order,
or any other random order *not related to their weights* . Match the
first pig eating ration A with the first pig eating ration B, and also
match the second pigs, the third pigs, and so forth. Then count the
number of matched pairs on which ration A does better. On nine of twelve
pairings ration A does better, that is, 31.0 \> 26.0, 34.0 \> 24.0, and
so forth.

Now we can ask: *If* the two rations are equally good, how often will
one ration exceed the other nine or more times out of twelve, just by
chance? This is the same as asking how often either heads *or* tails
will come up nine or more times in twelve tosses. (This is a
"two-tailed" test because, as far as we know, either ration may be as
good as or better than the other.) Once we have decided to treat the
problem in this manner, it is quite similar to Example 15-1 (the first
fruitfly irradiation problem). We ask how likely it is that the outcome
will be as far away as the observed outcome (9 "heads" of 12) from 6 of
12 (which is what we expect to get by chance in this case if the two
rations are similar).

So we conduct perhaps fifty trials as in Table 17-3, where an asterisk
denotes nine or more heads or tails.

**Step 1.** Let odd numbers equal "A better" and even numbers equal "B
better."

**Step 2.** Examine 12 random digits and check whether 9 or more, or 3
or less, are odd. If so, record "yes," otherwise "no."

**Step 3.** Repeat step 2 fifty times.

**Step 4.** Compute the proportion "yes," which estimates the
probability sought.

The results are shown in Table 17-3.

In 8 of 50 simulation trials, one or the other ration had nine or more
tosses in its favor. Therefore, we estimate the probability to be .16
(eight of fifty) that samples this different would be generated by
chance if the samples came from the same universe.

Now for a RESAMPLING STATS program and results. "Pigs2" is different
from "Pigs1" in that it compares the weight-gain results of *pairs* of
pigs, instead of simply looking at the *rankings* for weight gains.

The key to "Pigs2" is the GENERATE statement. If we assume that ration A
does not have an effect on weight gain (which is the "benchmark" or
"null" hypothesis), then the results of the actual experiment would be
no different than if we randomly GENERATE numbers "1" and "2" and treat
a "1" as a larger weight gain for the ration A pig, and a "2" as a
larger weight gain for the ration B pig. Both events have a .5 chance of
occurring for each pair of pigs because if the rations had no effect on weight
gain (the null hypothesis), ration A pigs would have larger weight gains about
half of the time. The next step is to COUNT the number of times that the
weight gains of one group (call it the group fed with ration A) were larger
than the weight gains of the other (call it the group fed with ration B). The
complete program follows:


<!--- Resampling stats file; Matlab syntax closeish -->

```matlab
' Program file: "pigs2.rss"

REPEAT 1000
    ' Do 1000 trials
    GENERATE 12 1,2 a
    ' Generate randomly 12 "1"s and "2"s, put them in a. This represents 12
    ' "pairings" where "1" = ration a "wins," "2" = ration b = "wins."
    COUNT a =1 b
    ' Count the number of "pairings" where ration a won, put the result in b.
    SCORE b z
    ' Keep track of the result in z
END
' End the trial, go back and repeat until all 100 trials are complete.
COUNT z >= 9 j
' Determine how often we got 9 or more "wins" for ration a.
COUNT z <= 3 k
' Determine how often we got 3 or fewer "wins" for ration a.
ADD j k m
' Add the two together
DIVIDE m 100 mm
' Convert to a proportion
PRINT mm
' Print the result.

' Note: The file "pigs2" on the Resampling Stats software disk contains
' this set of commands.
```

Notice how we proceeded in Examples 15-6 and 17-4. The data were
originally quantitative — weight gains in pounds for each pig. But for
simplicity we classified the data into simpler counted-data formats. The
first format (Example 15-6) was a rank order, from highest to lowest.
The second format (Example 17-4) was simply higher-lower, obtained by
randomly pairing the observations (using alphabetical letter, or pig's
stall number, or whatever was the cause of the order in which the data
were presented to be random). Classifying the data in either of these
ways loses some information and makes the subsequent tests somewhat
cruder than more refined analysis could provide (as we shall see in the
next chapter), but the loss of efficiency is not crucial in many such
cases. We shall see how to deal directly with the quantitative data in
@sec-testing-measured.

**Example 17-5: Merged Firms Compared to Two Non-Merged Groups**

In a study by Simon, Mokhtari, and Simon [-@simon1996mergers], a set of 33
advertising agencies that merged over a period of years were each compared to
entities within two groups (each also of 33 firms) that did not merge; one
non-merging group contained firms of roughly the same size as the final merged
entities, and the other non-merging group contained pairs of non-merging firms
whose total size was roughly the same as the total size of the merging
entities.

The idea behind the matching was that each pair of merged firms was
compared against

1.  a pair of contemporaneous firms that were roughly the same size as
    the merging firms *before* the merger, and

2.  a single firm that was roughly the same size as the merged entity
    *after* the merger.

    Here (Table 17-4) are the data (provided by the authors):

    Comparisons were made in several years before and after the mergings
    to see whether the merged entities did better or worse than the
    non-merging entities they were matched with by the researchers, but
    for simplicity we may focus on just one of the more important years
    in which they were compared — say, the revenue growth rates in the
    year after the merger.

    Here are those average revenue growth rates for the three groups:

    **Year's rev. growth**

      --------- ----------
      MERGED    -0.0213
      MATCH 1   0.092085
      MATCH 2   0.095931
      --------- ----------

    We could do a general test to determine whether there are differences
    among the means of the three groups, as was done in the "Differences Among
    4 Pig Rations" problem (@sec-pig-rations-measured). However, we note that
    there may be considerable variation from one matched set to another —
    variation which can obscure the overall results if we resample from a
    large general bucket.

    Therefore, we use the following resampling procedure that maintains
    the separation between matched sets by converting each observation
    into a rank (1, 2 or 3) within the matched set.

    Here (Table 17-5) are those ranks:

    These are the average ranks for the three groups (1 = worst, 3

    = best):

      --------- ------
      MERGED    1.45
      MATCH 1   2.18
      MATCH 2   2.36
      --------- ------

    Is it possible that the merged group received such a low (poor)
    average ranking just by chance? The null hypothesis is that the
    ranks within each set were assigned randomly, and that "merged" came
    out so poorly just by chance. The following procedure simulates
    random assignment of ranks to the "merged" group:

    1.  Randomly select 33 integers between "1" and "3" (inclusive).

    2.  Find the average rank & record.

    3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2, say, 1000 times.

    4.  Find out how often the average rank is as low as 1.45

Here's a RESAMPLING STATS program ("merge.sta"):

END
HISTOGRAM z
COUNT z <=1.45 k
DIVIDE k 1000 kk
PRINT kk
```

Result: kk = 0

Interpretation: 1000 random selections of 33 ranks never produced an
average as low as the observed average. Therefore we rule out chance as
an explanation for the poor ranking of the merged firms.

Exactly the same technique might be used in experimental medical studies
wherein subjects in an experimental group are matched with two different
entities that receive placebos or control treatments.

For example, there have been several recent three-way tests of
treatments for depression: drug therapy versus cognitive therapy versus
combined drug and cognitive therapy. If we are interested in the
combined drug-therapy treatment in particular, comparing it to standard
existing treatments, we can proceed in the same fashion as in the merger
problem.

We might just as well consider the real data from the merger as
hypothetical data for a proposed test in 33 triplets of people that have
been matched within triplet by sex, age, and years of education. The
three treatments were to be chosen randomly within each triplet.

Assume that we now switch scales from the merger data, so that \#1 =
best and \#3 = worst, and that the outcomes on a series of tests were
ranked from best (\#1) to worst (\#3) within each triplet. Assume that
the combined drug-and-therapy regime has the best average rank. How sure
can we be that the observed result would not occur by chance? Here are
the data from the merger study, seen here as Table 17-5-b:

  33   1   3   2
  ---- --- --- ---

These are the average ranks for the three groups ("1" = best, "3"=
worst):

  ---------- ------
  Combined   1.45
  Drug       2.18
  Therapy    2.36
  ---------- ------

In these hypothetical data, the average rank for the drug and therapy
regime is 1.45. Is it likely that the regimes do not "really" differ
with respect to effectiveness, and that the drug and therapy regime came
out with the best rank just by the luck of the draw? We test by asking,
"If there is no difference, what is the probability that the treatment
of interest will get an average rank this good, just by chance?"

We proceed exactly as with the solution for the merger problem (see
above).

In the above problems, we did not concern ourselves with chance outcomes
for the other therapies (or the matched firms) because they were not our
primary focus. If, in actual fact, one of them had done exceptionally
well or poorly, we would have paid little notice because their
performance was not the object of the study. We needed, therefore, only
to guard against the possibility that chance good luck for *our therapy
of interest* might have led us to a hasty conclusion.

Suppose now that we are not interested primarily in the combined
drug-therapy treatment, and that we have three treatments being tested,
all on equal footing. It is no longer sufficient to ask the question
"What is the probability that the combined therapy could come out this
well just by chance?" We must now ask "What is the probability that
*any* of the therapies could have come out this well by chance?"
(Perhaps you can guess that this probability will be higher than the
probability that our *chosen therapy* will do so well by chance.)

Here is a resampling procedure that will answer this question:

1.  Put the numbers "1", "2" and "3" (corresponding to ranks) in a bucket

2.  Shuffle the numbers and deal them out to three locations that
    correspond to treatments (call the locations "t1," "t2," and "t3")

3.  Repeat step two another 32 times (for a total of 33 repetitions, for
    33 matched triplets)

4.  Find the average rank for each location (treatment.

5.  Record the minimum (best) score.

6.  Repeat steps 2-4, say, 1000 times.

7.  Find out how often the minimum average rank for any treatment is as
    low as 1.45

```

Interpretation: 1000 random shufflings of 33 ranks, apportioned to three
"treatments," never produced for the best treatment in the three an average as
low as the observed average, therefore we rule out chance as an explanation
for the success of the combined therapy.

An interesting feature of the mergers (or depression treatment) problem
is that it would be hard to find a conventional test that would handle
this three-way comparison in an efficient manner. Certainly it would be
impossible to find a test that does not require formulae and tables that
only a talented professional statistician could manage satisfactorily,
and even s/ he is not likely to fully understand those formulaic
procedures.

Result: kk = 0

## Technical note

Some of the tests introduced in this chapter are similar to standard
nonparametric rank and sign tests. They differ less in the structure of the
test statistic than in the way in which significance is assessed (the
comparison is to multiple simulations of a model based on the benchmark
hypothesis, rather than to critical values calculated analytically).
