# Datasets for Resampling with ... book


Lough Erne data from table 1 from Zhou et al 2000, Wat. Res. Vol. 34, No. 3,
pp. 922-926, read directly from the PDF of the paper.

Mercury prices from <https://www.metalary.com/mercury-price>

Premier league statistics via
<https://github.com/odsti/datasets/tree/main/premier_league>, and generated by
`./premier_league.py` in this directory.

Congressional districts and income via
<https://github.com/odsti/datasets/tree/main/congress_118>, and generated by
`./congress.py`.

Merger comparison data `mergers.csv` comes directly from the original
book text, recorded in the text as:

> ... data (provided by the authors)

â€” where the authors are Simon, Mokhtari, and Simon (1996) (see bibliography).

`cholost.csv` derives from the classic Efron and Tibshirani [-@efron1993bootstrap, page 72] reference on bootstrap methods.   The data copy here comes via the R `bootstrap` library:

From: <https://rdrr.io/cran/bootstrap/man/cholost.html>

> n=164 men took part in an experiment to see if the drug cholostyramine
lowered blood cholesterol levels. The men were supposed to take six packets of
cholostyramine per day, but many actually took much less.
>
> ...
> A data frame with 164 observations on the following 2 variables.
>
> z: Compliance, a numeric vector
>
> y: Improvement, a numeric vector

I wrote the data with:

```r
install.packages('bootstrap')
write.csv(bootstrap::cholost, 'cholost.csv', row.names=FALSE)
```

I have changed the column names to `percent_compliance` and `cholesterol_decrease`.
